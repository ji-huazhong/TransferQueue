Tutorial 5: Streaming DataLoader for Distributed Training

This script demonstrates how to use StreamingDataset and StreamingDataLoader
for efficient streaming data loading in distributed training scenarios.

Key Components:
- StreamingDataset: PyTorch IterableDataset that integrates with TransferQueue
- StreamingDataLoader: DataLoader wrapper that yields (batch, batch_meta) tuples
- RankAwareSampler: Enables DP group coordination for consistent
  sampling across multiple ranks

Use Cases:
- Distributed training with multiple DP groups
- Fine-grained micro-batch-level data retrieval
